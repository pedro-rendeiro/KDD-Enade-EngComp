Data Mining with the ENADE of the Brazilian Computer Science courses

## About the Project

Enade is the exam applied at the end of the course in order to measure the performance of students.
This analysis uses ENADE microdata for all the Brazilian Computer Science Courses.
The goal is to provide information that can be useful for directors and coordinators
who want to improve the quality of their courses. 

The data tells:

1. which are the deficient subjects of the course (e.g., computer networks, software engineering, etc);
2. what is the change in performance in a given subject over the years; 
3. if the students have low participation in the exam.
